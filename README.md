# Geodesic Analysis via Sasaki Metric



## Riemannian metric on the tangent bundle
    A prominent natural metric on the tangent bundle TM of a Riemannian manifold M is the Sasaki metric.
    Its characterization: Canonical projection of TM becomes a Riemannian submersion, parallel vector fields
    along curves are orthogonal to their fibres, and restriction to any tangent space is Euclidean.
## Longitudinal analysis and mean geodesic

## Something on Implementation: Little bug in geomstats/pre_shape.py, thus as standalone in this project???
